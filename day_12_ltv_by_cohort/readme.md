# Day 12 — LTV by Cohort Analysis

## ❓ Business Question
How does Lifetime Value (LTV) evolve across cohorts over time?

## 🧩 Business Context
While cohort revenue shows total money generated, **LTV explains value per user**.
LTV by cohort helps the business:
- compare acquisition quality,
- estimate long-term revenue potential,
- decide how much can be spent on acquisition (CAC).

This analysis builds directly on the cohort revenue logic.

## 📐 Definitions
- **Cohort month**: month of first payment.
- **Cohort age**: months since first payment.
- **LTV**: cumulative revenue per user in a cohort.

LTV = Cumulative Revenue / Number of Users in Cohort
