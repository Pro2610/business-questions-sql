# Day 13 — Stickiness Analysis (Active Payers: MAU / WAU Proxy)

## ❓ Business Question
How sticky is the product, based on how frequently paying users return?

## 🧩 Business Context
Stickiness measures how often users come back.
When event-level activity is unavailable, **active payers** can be used as a proxy
for engagement and product value.

This analysis helps the business:
- assess product habit-forming strength,
- compare engagement trends over time,
- identify risks masked by revenue growth.

## 📐 Definitions (Proxy-based)
- **DAU (proxy)**: daily active payers
- **WAU (proxy)**: weekly active payers
- **MAU (proxy)**: monthly active payers
- **Stickiness ratios**:
  - DAU / MAU
  - WAU / MAU

> Note: This is a conservative proxy. True stickiness is higher when non-paying activity exists.
