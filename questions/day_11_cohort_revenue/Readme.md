# Day 11 — Cohort Revenue Analysis

## ❓ Business Question
How does revenue evolve over time across different user cohorts?

## 🧩 Business Context
Cohort analysis helps understand long-term revenue behavior.
Instead of looking at totals, we analyze how users acquired in the same period
(cohort) generate revenue over time.

This allows the business to:
- evaluate monetization quality of different cohorts,
- detect retention or pricing issues early,
- compare cohort performance objectively.

## 📐 Cohort Definition
- **Cohort month**: the month of a user’s first payment.
- **Cohort age**: number of months since the first payment.
