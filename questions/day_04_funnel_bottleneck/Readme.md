# Day 04 — Funnel Bottleneck Analysis

## ❓ Business Question
Where is the biggest drop-off in the conversion funnel?

## 🧩 Business Context
The business observes lower-than-expected conversion to payment.
To improve revenue, we need to identify:
- which funnel step causes the highest drop-off,
- whether the issue is global or segment-specific.

## 📐 Funnel Definition
For this analysis, the funnel is defined as:
1. User registered
2. User made first payment
3. User made second payment (repeat)

Each step must happen after the previous one.
