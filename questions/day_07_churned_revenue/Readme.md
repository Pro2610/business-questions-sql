# Day 07 — Churned Revenue Analysis

## ❓ Business Question
How much revenue is being lost due to churned users?

## 🧩 Business Context
User churn alone does not fully reflect business impact.
Losing a high-spending user is more damaging than losing multiple low-value users.

This analysis focuses on **churned revenue**, not just churned users.

## 📐 Definitions
- **Churned user**: a user who had revenue in the previous month
  but generated no revenue in the current month.
- **Churned revenue**: revenue generated by churned users
  in their last active month.
