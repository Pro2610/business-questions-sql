# Day 09 — Reactivated Users Analysis

## ❓ Business Question
How many users were reactivated after a period of inactivity, and how much revenue did they generate?

## 🧩 Business Context
Reactivating churned users is often cheaper than acquiring new ones.
Understanding reactivation helps the business:
- evaluate lifecycle and win-back campaigns,
- estimate recovered revenue,
- optimize retention strategies.

- **Inactive user**: a user with no payments for at least 30 consecutive days.
