- Discounts increase transaction volume but often **reduce ARPPU**.
- Discount-driven users do not consistently demonstrate higher retention.
- High-value users are not strongly dependent on discounts.

**Implication:**  
Discounts should be used **selectively** (acquisition or reactivation), not as a broad strategy.
