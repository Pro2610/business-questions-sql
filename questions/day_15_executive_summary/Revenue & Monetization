- Revenue fluctuations are primarily driven by **changes in the number of paying users**, not ARPPU.
- A small share of users (power users) generates a **disproportionately large portion of total revenue**.
- Churned revenue analysis shows that **losing high-value users has a significant financial impact**.

**Implication:**  
Revenue stability depends more on **retaining high-value users** than on acquiring new low-value ones.
